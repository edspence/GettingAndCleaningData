# GettingAndCleaningData

This repositry is for my submission to Coursera's Data Science module, Getting and Cleaning Data.

# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

# R script instructions:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# The files contained in this repository are:

Codebook.md describes the raw data files and how they were edited following tidy data principals for downstream analysis.

run_analysis.R is the R code used to edit the raw files.

TidyData.csv is the output of the R code, to be used for downstream analysis.
